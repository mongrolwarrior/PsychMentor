                    Let us return to the animal phobia of Little Hans. Here we have a clinical example of simultaneous defensive processes directed respectively inward and outward. We are told that the little boy's neurosis was based on impulses quite normally associated with the oedipus cmoplex. He love his mother and out of jealousy adopted an aggressive attitude toward his father, which secondarily came into cnflict with his tender affection for him. These aggressive impulses roused his castration anxiety - which he experienced as objective anxiety - and so the various mechanisms of defense against the instincts were set in motion.</GenericQuestion>

The analyst (who was Hans's father) had no difficulty in recognizing in these fantasies the fulfillment of the two wishes which had never been fulfilled in reality.
